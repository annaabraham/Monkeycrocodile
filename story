iA long time ago, there was a monkey who lived in a rose-apple tree by the side of a river.He lived alone, but was very happy.One day a crocodile came out of the river.He swam upto the tree and told the monkey that he travelled a long distance and was in search of food as he was very hungry.The kind monkey offered him a few rose apples.The crocodile thanked him and asked the monkey if he could visit again.
"You are always welcome" ,said the monkey.
        After that the crocodile started visiting the monkey everyday.They would share rose apples and talk about everything they knew.
